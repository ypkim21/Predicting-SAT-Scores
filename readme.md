# Abstract
What kinds of correlations exist between socioeconomic factors and SAT performance? Can a
machine learning model predict SAT performance based on city socioeconomic data? In order to
solve this problem, machine learning regression models were used to predict average scores for
the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) administered by College Board. Such models utilized city
and SAT data collected from government census data and state education department SAT data.
Although the models did perform better than the baseline metric, they were not as accurate as
expected. Despite these limited results, they do indicate a slight correlation, which may provide
further insight for future researchers with more resources at their disposal.
